<h1>100 solved algorithm exercises</h1>
<p>In this program, you have the opportunity to test any of the 100 algorithms proposed by Gustavo Guanabara in his algorithm list. If you encounter difficulties solving it on your own, you can rely on my solution for guidance.</p>
<p>When testing the program, you'll see that it is entirely in Portuguese. The intention was to do everything in English when I started, but I got carried away with solving the algorithms and ended up doing everything in Portuguese, haha.</p>
<h3>Instructions for using the program</h3>
<p>Basically, you can enter a number from 1 to 100 to test one of the proposed algorithms on the list, or you can enter 0 to exit the program.</p>
